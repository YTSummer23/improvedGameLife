# A lives of the cells

## Description
This project is an attempt to make kind of simulation of evolution. Not real one, though.
Some basic geometry with vectors is done so far. `struct Cell` is almost described .

## TODO

* Make cell division mechanism.
* Make AI for a cell.
* Make graphic. I'll use sfml.
* Describe `struct Multicellular`. And make game mechanics for it.
* Make AI for this.
