# A lives of the cells

This project is an attempt to make kind of simulation of evolution. Not real one, though.
Some basic geometry with vectors is done so far. `struct Cell` is almost described .

## How to build

To build the program, just type `zig build` in your cmd

## How to test

* To test geomtry.zig, type `zig build test-geometry`
* To test cell.zig, type `zig build test-cell`

### TODO

* ~~Make cell division mechanism.~~ (Completed)
* Make eating mechanism.
* Make AI for a cell.
* Make graphic. I'll use sfml.
* Describe `struct Multicellular`. And make game mechanics for it.
* Make AI for this.
